# Exploration of World Happiness Report Data
## Note: Please open the .ipynb file in Google colab to interact with the world map. Click the 'Open in Colab' icon once you're in the Ipython notebook. 

This project aims to understand how the Happiness or as it is called 'Cantril Ladder Score' of countries is measured. Then it aims to show how these scores are distributed using Plotly library's interactive choropleths, and other seaborn and matplotlib visualizations. The report also has various other metrics present that do not determine the happiness score but play a role in gauging the overall 'well-being' of the people in the country. Therefore, this project also tries to predict the happiness scores based on these non-causal metrics through Linear Regression.

Furthermore, the report also groups the countries into three distinct classes (Thriving, Struggling, Suffering) based on their happiness score. The project, using K-Means clustering and PCA tries to cluster the countries into a similar category from the other metrics of the report.
